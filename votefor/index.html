        I am Parvez Mahbub, a Master’s student at the Department of Computer Science. Along with the
        study, I am employed as a teaching assistant in different graduate courses, working as a
        research scholar at Raise Lab and a research intern at Metabob under the Mitacs Accelerate
        Program. My primary research interest lies in natural language processing, deep learning,
        and software engineering. Before joining the Master’s program, I worked as a professional
        software engineer for more than two years. During the job, along with the apparent industry
        works, I hosted several workshops on different cutting-edge technologies to enhance the
        calibre of fellow engineers. Apart from academics, I am always active in different
        extra-curricular activities. During my undergraduate studies, I acted as the IT secretary
        of CLUSTER — the computer club of Khulna University, Bangladesh, where my primary
        responsibility was to oversee the technical aspects of different services provided by the
        Computer Science and Engineering discipline. I also acted as the Head of Promotion of Podium,
        Khulna University — an organization for improving public speaking skills. My primary
        responsibility was to host the public speaking sessions and communicate with the guest
        speakers. While working in these roles, I had to synchronize and maintain a collaborative
        relationship with several other intra-university and inter-university organizations and
        technology vendors. Such responsibility helped me nourish the skills to achieve the best
        mutual benefit for different organizations. Therefore, I believe the Vice President of
        External Advocacy is the best place for me to contribute for the graduate students of Dalhousie University.

        Being a graduate student myself, I am well aware of graduate students’ problems and difficulties. I started my
        study in the middle of the covid situation and experienced different study models, including online
        synchro-nous/asynchronous, hybrid, and in-person. I have faced and seen students facing difficulties coping with
        the different models and still being productive. Therefore, I can work with the Faculty of graduate studies to
        smooth the transition.
        Especially when everything is going in-person gradually, complying with the changing industry need would be a
        critical concern for graduate students in the upcoming days. I believe my industry experience can play a vital
        role in ensuring external resources to help the students prepare for the changing needs.
        Furthermore, my former experiences of representing my organization and working with other organizations for
        mutual benefit will help me to stand out as a Vice President of External Advocacy.

        <p>
          I have worked and still working as a teaching assistant in a couple of graduate courses.
          These courses shared different delivery schemes like hybrid and in-person. I have seen
          graduate students face difficulties coping with the delivery models, understanding the
          content, and understanding various evaluation criteria during the job. In the light of such
          experience, I will work with the Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) and Dalhousie Student
